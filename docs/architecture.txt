# System Architecture

## Overview
This project follows a modular architecture that separates
CAN communication logic from the UI layer.

The design simulates a typical automotive HMI system where
vehicle data is collected from the CAN bus and visualized
in real time.

## Backend Layer
- CAN Receiver:
  - Responsible for receiving raw CAN frames
  - Supports both real CAN and simulated input
- CAN Parser:
  - Decodes CAN ID and data bytes
  - Maps frames to vehicle signals (RPM, speed, temperature)

## UI Layer
- QML Dashboard
- Receives parsed signals via Qt properties
- Designed for real-time updates

## Design Decisions
- Separation of backend and UI for scalability
- CAN simulation support to enable development without hardware
- Signal-slot communication to ensure thread safety

## Future Improvements
- DBC-based signal parsing
- UDS diagnostics integration
- Multi-threaded CAN processing
